# LangGraph Implementation Plan - Full Architecture Migration
## Complete Transition from Sequential Pipeline to LangGraph Orchestration

### Overview

This implementation plan details the complete migration from the current sequential pipeline in `server.ts` to the full LangGraph orchestration architecture. Based on the analysis, we have 70% of the infrastructure already built and need to complete the orchestration layer and advanced features.

- **Current**: Lines 392-432 in `server.ts` execute steps sequentially

#### 2. State Persistence & Checkpointing
- **Problem**: No persistent state management in API endpoints
- **Impact**: No support for long-running searches or recovery
- **Missing**: Thread management, state recovery, async operations

#### 3. Adaptive Refinement Cycles

  ENABLE_STREAMING: process.env.ENABLE_STREAMING === 'true',
  ENABLE_REFINEMENT: process.env.ENABLE_REFINEMENT === 'true'
};
```

### Rollout Plan

2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with existing test cases
3. **Staging**: Deploy with feature flags disabled by default
4. **Production**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
5. **Full Migration**: Enable all features after validation

### Risk Mitigation
