# Feature Specification: Frontend Container Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `006-frontend-container-optimization`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "## Frontend Container Optimization Specification
### Problem Statement
The current frontend container suffers from severe resource inefficiency:

- Excessive memory consumption : 521.9MB for serving static React assets
- Bloated image size : 577MB due to unnecessary Node.js runtime in production
- Architectural mismatch : Using Node.js environment to serve pre-built static files instead of optimized web server
### Expected Outcome
Transform the frontend container into a lightweight, production-optimized solution:

- Target memory usage : <30MB (95% reduction from current 521.9MB)
- Target image size : <50MB (90% reduction from current 577MB)
- Architecture : Multi-stage build producing static assets served by nginx/alpine
- Performance : Sub-second container startup with minimal resource footprint suitable for edge deployment
The optimized container should maintain full functionality while eliminating the Node.js runtime overhead, achieving enterprise-grade efficiency for static asset delivery."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator deploying CodiesVibe, I need the frontend container to consume minimal system resources while maintaining full functionality, so that I can deploy the application efficiently in resource-constrained environments and reduce operational costs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current frontend container consuming 521.9MB memory, **When** the optimized container is deployed, **Then** memory consumption should be reduced to under 30MB
2. **Given** the current frontend image size of 577MB, **When** the optimized image is built, **Then** the image size should be under 50MB
3. **Given** a production deployment environment, **When** the optimized frontend container starts, **Then** startup time should be under 1 second
4. **Given** users accessing the frontend application, **When** using the optimized container, **Then** all existing functionality should remain intact without degradation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the container runs in extremely memory-constrained environments (under 64MB available)? > it will never happen, as the deployment machine will always be having enough memory to run the container
- How does the system handle graceful shutdown and restart scenarios? > The system will handle graceful shutdown and restart scenarios by using the default behavior of nginx, which is to wait for active requests to complete before shutting down.
- What happens during high-traffic periods with the reduced resource footprint? > this is a static react app, so it will handle high traffic periods without any degradation in performance.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST serve all static React application assets with identical functionality to current implementation
- **FR-002**: System MUST consume as less as possible of runtime memory during normal operation, ideally under 30MB
- **FR-003**: System MUST produce container images smaller than 50MB in total size
- **FR-004**: System MUST start containers in under 1 second from deployment trigger
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing deployment configurations and environment variables
- **FR-006**: System MUST support graceful shutdown and health check endpoints
- **FR-007**: System MUST serve static assets with appropriate HTTP caching headers and compression
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle concurrent user requests without performance degradation compared to current implementation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Frontend Container**: Optimized runtime environment for serving static React assets with minimal resource footprint
- **Static Assets**: Pre-built React application files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) that need efficient delivery
- **Container Image**: Packaged deployment artifact containing optimized web server and application assets
