# Feature Specification: NestJS REST API Backend with MongoDB

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-nestjs`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a NestJS REST API backend with MongoDB that provides user authentication via GitHub OAuth, CRUD operations for managing data collections, search endpoints with filtering capabilities, and user analytics tracking. The API should include JWT-based authentication with protected routes, request validation using DTOs, rate limiting, comprehensive Swagger documentation, and structured error handling. Implement modular architecture with separate modules for auth, search, and analytics, each containing controllers, services, and schemas. Include MongoDB schemas for users and analytics collections with proper indexing. Set up caching layer, logging, configuration management, and health check endpoints. The API should be fully documented with OpenAPI/Swagger and include proper TypeScript types throughout."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Developers and client applications need to interact with a secure, scalable NestJS API backend (located in `/backend` directory) that provides user authentication through GitHub and manages tools with full CRUD capabilities. The system should provide comprehensive documentation and maintain high reliability through proper error handling and monitoring.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to access protected resources, **When** they authenticate via GitHub OAuth, **Then** they receive a JWT token that grants access to API endpoints
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they create, read, update, or delete tools, **Then** the operations are completed successfully with proper validation
3. **Given** a user needs to find specific tools, **When** they use search endpoints with filters, **Then** they receive relevant results based on their criteria
5. **Given** a developer integrates with the API, **When** they access the documentation, **Then** they find comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
6. **Given** high traffic or errors occur, **When** the system processes requests, **Then** rate limiting prevents abuse and errors are handled gracefully

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GitHub OAuth service is unavailable?
- How does the system handle malformed search queries or invalid filters?
- What occurs when rate limits are exceeded by a user or IP address?
- How are database connection failures managed during CRUD operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users via GitHub OAuth integration
- **FR-002**: System MUST issue JWT tokens for authenticated sessions with configurable expiration
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide CRUD operations for tools with proper authorization
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate all incoming requests using structured data transfer objects
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement search functionality with filtering capabilities across tools
- **FR-007**: System MUST enforce rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle errors gracefully with structured error responses
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide comprehensive API documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI
- **FR-010**: System MUST include health check endpoints for monitoring system status
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement caching mechanisms for improved performance
- **FR-012**: System MUST log system activities for debugging and audit purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST support configuration management for different environments
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to access only their own tools unless granted additional permissions
- **FR-015**: System MUST persist user profiles with appropriate indexing for performance
- **FR-016**: System MUST be implemented in `/backend` directory to separate from frontend code
- **FR-018**: Rate limiting MUST be configured at 100 requests per minute per user and 1000 requests per minute per IP
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle up to 100 concurrent users with reasonable response times under 500ms
- **FR-017**: Search filtering MUST support text search on tool names and descriptions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents authenticated individuals with GitHub accounts, contains profile information and permission levels
- **Tool**: Simple data objects with id, name, and description for demonstrating CRUD operations
