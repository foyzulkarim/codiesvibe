  - Node 18-alpine; install, build, run `node dist/server.js`; expose 4002
  - Acceptance: Image builds locally; container starts and `/health` works
  - ✅ **Completed**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with Node 18-alpine, security best practices (non-root user), proper build/production separation, health checks, and optimized runtime configuration.

- [x] **[SF031] Add compose service definition**
  - Files: `docker-compose.infra.yml` (dev) and/or `docker-compose.production.yml`
  - Add `search-api` service with `dockerfile: Dockerfile.search`, `ports: "4002:4002"`, env (`MONGO_URI`, `DB_NAME`, `COLLECTION_NAME`, `OLLAMA_URL`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`, `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`), `networks: codiesvibe-network`, `depends_on: mongodb` when applicable
  - Acceptance: `docker-compose up -d` brings up search-api; `/health` OK
  - ✅ **Completed**: Comprehensive Docker Compose configurations with both development and production setups. Dev version includes full monitoring stack (MongoDB, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Ollama). Production version includes resource limits, Nginx reverse proxy, and external environment variable configuration.
