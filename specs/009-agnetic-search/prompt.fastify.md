- **0.5-0.6 (Moderate)**: Reasonable approach, some ambiguity, acceptable results with caveats
- **0.3-0.4 (Low)**: Significant uncertainty, suboptimal approach, results may be incomplete
- **0.0-0.2 (Poor)**: High uncertainty, likely errors, results unreliable or incomplete

### Confidence Calibration Guidelines
- **Query Complexity Factor**: Reduce confidence by 0.1-0.2 for highly complex queries
- **Tool Availability Factor**: Reduce confidence by 0.1-0.3 if optimal tools unavailable

- **Result Completeness Factor**: Reduce confidence by 0.1-0.3 for incomplete or partial results

### Confidence Threshold Actions
- **≥ 0.8**: Present results directly with confidence statement
- **0.6-0.7**: Present results with caveats and limitations noted
- **0.4-0.5**: Present results with strong caveats and suggest refinement
- **< 0.4**: Request clarification or additional information before proceeding

## Context Preservation and Iteration Strategy

CONTEXT PRESERVATION:
- Maintain queryContext across iterations: {intent, entities, constraints}
- Track confidenceScores for each reasoning step
- Update disambiguationState when clarification is needed
- Preserve toolHistory for transparency and debugging

ITERATION STRATEGY:
- Maximum 10 iterations per query (MAX_ITERATIONS)
- Stop when: isComplete=true, satisfactory results, or confidence threshold met
- Continue when: low confidence, ambiguous results, or incomplete filtering

AMBIGUITY HANDLING:
- Detect ambiguous queries (confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD)
- Generate specific clarification requests
- Provide refinement suggestions
- Wait for user input before proceeding

TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- Show reasoning chain in final response
- Explain why tools were selected
- Disclose assumptions made
- Highlight any limitations or uncertainties

1.  Analyze current gap between user intent and current results
2.  Identify which tool category best addresses this gap
3.  Select specific tool within that category
4.  Determine optimal parameters
5.  Estimate confidence of success

REASONING REQUIREMENTS:

  - Why this tool over alternatives
  - What you expect this tool to achieve
  - How this fits into overall strategy
  - Confidence level for this specific action

Output tool selection following the JSON schema for planner responses.

## 4\. Context Management Prompts

### 4.1 Context Preservation (`prompts/context/preservation.md`)

```
CONTEXT PRESERVATION PROTOCOL

Current Query Context:
{
  "intent": "Primary user goal and objectives",
  "entities": {
    "mentioned_tools": ["tools explicitly referenced"],
    "required_features": ["features user wants"],
    "constraints": {"price": "budget limits", "platform": "platform requirements"},
    "exclusions": ["things to avoid"]
  },
  "interpretation": "How query was understood",
  "assumptions": ["assumptions made during interpretation"]
}

CONTEXT UPDATE RULES:
1. PRESERVE CORE INTENT: Never lose sight of the primary user goal
2. ACCUMULATE CONSTRAINTS: Add new constraints as they emerge
3. REFINE ENTITIES: Update entity understanding as more is learned
4. TRACK ASSUMPTIONS: Keep record of all assumptions made
5. MAINTAIN HISTORY: Preserve reasoning chain for transparency

CONTEXT DRIFT DETECTION:
Warning Signs:
- Moving away from original intent
- Contradicting earlier assumptions
- Ignoring explicit user constraints
- Adding unstated requirements

Drift Prevention:
- Always check new actions against original query
- Validate that context updates are consistent
- Maintain clear audit trail of changes
- Request clarification if major shifts needed

CONTEXT MERGING:
When new information arrives:
1. Check for conflicts with existing context
2. Resolve conflicts by prioritizing explicit user statements
3. Update context incrementally
4. Document what changed and why
5. Validate merged context makes sense
```

### 4.2 Context Injection (`prompts/context/injection.md`)

```
CONTEXT INJECTION TEMPLATE

For each LLM call, inject relevant context:

SYSTEM CONTEXT:
{system_prompt_with_role_and_capabilities}

QUERY CONTEXT:
{
  "original_query": "{user_query}",
  "current_intent": "{refined_understanding}",
  "entities_extracted": {structured_entities},
  "constraints_applied": {active_constraints},
  "iteration_context": {
    "current_iteration": "{step_number}",
    "previous_actions": "{action_summary}",
    "results_so_far": "{result_summary}",
    "confidence_trend": "{confidence_history}"
  }
}

DATA CONTEXT:
{
  "dataset_info": {
    "total_tools": 500,
    "last_updated": "2024-01-01",
    "schema_summary": "{key_fields_and_types}"
  },
  "current_results": {
    "count": "{number_of_results}",
    "sample": "{representative_sample}",
    "quality_indicators": "{completeness, relevance_scores}"
  }
}

TOOL CONTEXT:
{
  "available_tools": "{relevant_tools_for_current_step}",
  "tool_usage_history": "{tools_used_so_far}",
  "tool_effectiveness": "{what_worked_well}",
  "remaining_options": "{tools_not_yet_tried}"
}

Format context as structured JSON for easy parsing by the LLM.
```

## 5\. Error Handling and Recovery

### 5.1 Error Classification (`prompts/error/classification.md`)

```
ERROR CLASSIFICATION AND RESPONSE

ERROR TYPES:

1. PARSING ERRORS
   - Malformed JSON in LLM response
   - Invalid tool parameters
   - Missing required fields
   - Response: Use regex extraction, partial parsing, fallback to rules

2. VALIDATION ERRORS
   - Tool doesn't exist
   - Parameters out of range
   - Invalid field references
   - Response: Parameter correction, tool substitution, request clarification

3. EXECUTION ERRORS
   - Tool execution failure
   - Data quality issues
   - Unexpected results
   - Response: Retry with different parameters, try alternative tool, graceful degradation

4. CONTEXT ERRORS
   - Lost track of user intent
   - Contradictory constraints
   - Ambiguity escalation
   - Response: Context reset, clarification request, confidence adjustment

5. SYSTEM ERRORS
   - Network timeouts
   - Resource exhaustion
   - Service unavailable
   - Response: Exponential backoff, fallback to cached results, error acknowledgment

ERROR RECOVERY STRATEGIES:

IMMEDIATE RECOVERY:
- Fix syntax errors and retry
- Use default parameters for invalid values
- Substitute with similar tools

SHORT-TERM RECOVERY:
- Simplify the approach
- Break complex operations into smaller steps
- Use alternative tool combinations

LONG-TERM RECOVERY:
- Request user clarification
- Acknowledge limitations
- Provide partial results with caveats

GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
- Return best effort results
- Explain what went wrong
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Maintain transparency about issues
```

### 5.2 Retry Logic (`prompts/error/retry.md`)

```
RETRY STRATEGY TEMPLATE

Retry Attempt: {current_attempt}/{max_retries}
Original Error: {error_description}
Failed Action: {failed_tool_and_parameters}

RETRY ANALYSIS:

1. ERROR ROOT CAUSE
   Primary cause: {what_actually_went_wrong}
   Contributing factors: {additional_issues}
   Severity: [ ] Critical [ ] Major [ ] Minor

2. RETRY WORTHINESS
   Likely to succeed: [ ] Yes [ ] Maybe [ ] No
   Reason for optimism: {why_this_might_work_now}
   Risk of repeated failure: {what_could_go_wrong_again}

3. RETRY STRATEGY
   [ ] SAME_WITH_FIX: Fix the issue and retry same approach
   [ ] MODIFIED_PARAMETERS: Adjust parameters and retry
   [ ] ALTERNATIVE_TOOL: Use different tool for same goal
   [ ] SIMPLIFIED_APPROACH: Break into smaller steps
   [ ] DIFFERENT_STRATEGY: Try completely different approach

4. MODIFICATION PLAN
   What to change: {specific_modifications}
   Why this helps: {rationale_for_changes}
   Expected outcome: {what_should_happen_now}

5. FALLBACK PLANNING
   If retry fails again: {next_fallback_option}
   Ultimate fallback: {final_option_if_all_else_fails}
   User communication: {how_to_explain_to_user}

6. CONFIDENCE ADJUSTMENT
   Previous confidence: {original_confidence}
   Adjusted confidence: {new_confidence_after_error}
   Reasoning for adjustment: {why_confidence_changed}

Execute retry with modifications and monitor for success.
```

## 6\. LangGraph Integration Prompts

### 6.1 Graph State Management (`prompts/langgraph/state.md`)

```
LANGGRAPH STATE MANAGEMENT

GRAPH STATE SCHEMA:
{
  "agentState": {
    "originalDataset": "Immutable reference dataset",
    "currentResults": "Current filtered results",
    "userQuery": "Original user query",
    "toolHistory": "History of tool applications",
    "iterationCount": "Current iteration number",
    "isComplete": "Completion status flag",
    "queryContext": {
      "intent": "Primary user intent",
      "entities": "Extracted entities",
      "constraints": "Applied constraints"
    },
    "confidenceScores": "Confidence for each reasoning step",
    "disambiguationState": "Clarification request status"
  }
}

STATE TRANSITION RULES:

PLANNER NODE:
- Input: Current state, user query
- Output: Updated state with planned action
- State changes: Add planned action to history, update context

EXECUTOR NODE:
- Input: State with planned action
- Output: Updated state with action results
- State changes: Execute tool, update results, increment iteration

EVALUATOR NODE:
- Input: State with action results
- Output: Updated state with completion assessment
- State changes: Set isComplete flag, update confidence, check termination

RESPONSE NODE:
- Input: Complete state
- Output: Formatted response
- State changes: No state modification (terminal node)

CLARIFICATION NODE:
- Input: State with ambiguity
- Output: Clarification request
- State changes: Update disambiguationState, pause execution

STATE PERSISTENCE:
- Maintain state across node transitions
- Preserve reasoning chain and history
- Track confidence evolution
- Enable rollback on failures
```

### 6.2 Node Coordination (`prompts/langgraph/coordination.md`)

```
LANGGRAPH NODE COORDINATION

NODE SELECTION LOGIC:

1. START → PLANNER
   Always begin with planner for initial action selection

2. PLANNER → EXECUTOR
   When: Valid action planned with reasonable confidence
   Condition: confidence > 0.5 AND valid tool selected

3. PLANNER → CLARIFICATION
   When: Query is ambiguous or confidence too low
   Condition: confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD OR ambiguity detected

4. EXECUTOR → EVALUATOR
   Always evaluate after execution

5. EVALUATOR → PLANNER
   When: More work needed and confidence acceptable
   Condition: !isComplete AND confidence > 0.3 AND iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS

6. EVALUATOR → RESPONSE
   When: Process complete or termination conditions met
   Condition: isComplete OR confidence < 0.3 OR iteration >= MAX_ITERATIONS

7. EVALUATOR → CLARIFICATION
   When: Confidence drops or new ambiguity emerges
   Condition: confidence_degraded OR new_ambiguity_detected

8. CLARIFICATION → PLANNER
   When: User provides clarification
   Condition: clarification_received AND context_updated

ERROR HANDLING FLOWS:

EXECUTOR FAILURE:
- If tool execution fails → EVALUATOR with error state
- Evaluator may retry with different tool or request clarification

PARSING FAILURE:
- If LLM response cannot be parsed → PLANNER with simplified prompt
- May fallback to rules-based planning

TIMEOUT FAILURE:
- If node execution times out → RESPONSE with partial results
- Include error information and limitations

CONTEXT DRIFT:
- If context becomes inconsistent → CLARIFICATION
- Request user guidance to realign

GRAPH EXECUTION STRATEGY:

- Parallel execution where possible (independent operations)
- Sequential execution for dependent operations
- Conditional branching based on confidence and completeness
- Early termination for clear success or failure cases
- Progress monitoring with intermediate checkpoints
```

### 8.2 Core Implementation Strategies

  - **Confidence Integration**: Implement confidence scoring at every decision point and use thresholds to trigger different behaviors (e.g., direct response vs. clarification).
  - **Error Recovery**: Build a multi-stage parsing pipeline with progressive fallbacks to handle malformed LLM responses gracefully.
  - **Context Preservation**: Maintain a coherent conversation state across multiple turns to handle follow-up queries and refinements effectively.
