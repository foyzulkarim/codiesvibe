# Feature Specification: Update Tools Schema to Match Frontend AITool Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-generate-a-mongoose`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Update the existing backend Tools Mongoose schema to match the comprehensive frontend AITool interface structure, data types, and validation rules..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on an AI tools directory application, I need to update the existing backend Tools schema to match the comprehensive frontend AITool interface, ensuring the database can store all the rich metadata (pricing, interface types, functionality, deployment options, ratings, features, tags, etc.) that the frontend currently uses with mock data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the existing simple Tool schema (name, description, createdBy), **When** updating to the comprehensive AITool schema, **Then** all new fields must be added with proper validation
2. **Given** an AI tool with comprehensive data (pricing, interface, functionality, etc.), **When** saving to the updated database schema, **Then** all fields must be stored with proper validation
3. **Given** the updated schema with array fields (pricing, interface, functionality, deployment), **When** saving data, **Then** arrays must be validated for allowed values and proper structure
4. **Given** the features object with boolean flags, **When** storing in the database, **Then** the Record<string, boolean> structure must be properly handled
5. **Given** the tags object with primary and secondary arrays, **When** querying, **Then** filtering by tag categories must work efficiently
6. **Given** numeric fields (popularity, rating, reviewCount), **When** storing data, **Then** proper validation ranges must be enforced
7. **Given** the CRUD operations, **When** schema is updated, **Then** all API endpoints must support the enhanced data structure
8. **Given** the updated DTOs, **When** creating or updating tools, **Then** validation must handle the comprehensive data structures
9. **Given** search functionality, **When** using the new searchKeywords array, **Then** text search must be enhanced to include keyword-based queries

### Edge Cases
- What happens when numeric fields (popularity, rating, reviewCount) exceed reasonable bounds? [Ans: Do the best guess and clamp the value]
- How does system handle empty arrays for required array fields? [Ans: Reject the data with validation error]
- What happens when searchKeywords contain special characters or are very long? [Ans: Truncate to 256 characters]
- How does system handle invalid URLs in logoUrl field? [Ans: Reject the data with validation error]
- What happens when features object contains non-boolean values? [Ans: Convert to boolean using strict equality check]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST update existing Tool schema to include all AITool interface fields
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement proper validation for all new schema fields
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate core required fields (name, description) and make new comprehensive fields optional with sensible defaults
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate array fields (pricing, interface, functionality, deployment) against predefined allowed values
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle numeric fields (popularity, rating, reviewCount) with proper validation ranges (0-100 for popularity, 0-5 for rating)
- **FR-006**: System MUST store features as a flexible object structure supporting Record<string, boolean> pattern
- **FR-007**: System MUST structure tags with nested primary and secondary string arrays
- **FR-008**: System MUST support optional longDescription field for detailed tool information
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate logoUrl as proper URL format when provided
- **FR-010**: System MUST enhance search functionality to include searchKeywords array for improved discoverability
- **FR-011**: System MUST update CRUD operations to handle comprehensive data structure
- **FR-012**: System MUST update DTOs (CreateToolDto, UpdateToolDto) to support new schema fields
- **FR-013**: System MUST update API endpoints to support enhanced data
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide database indexes for efficient querying on new searchable fields
- **FR-015**: System MUST support filtering and sorting by new fields (popularity, rating, tags, functionality)
- **FR-016**: System MUST implement the updated schema for new tool creation and updates
- **FR-017**: System MUST validate data consistency between frontend interface and backend schema
- **FR-018**: System MUST support bulk operations for tool management
