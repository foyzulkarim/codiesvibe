# Feature Specification: AI Tools Directory Search and Sort System

**Feature Branch**: `004-build-a-search`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a search and sorting system for the AI tools directory. Users can type in a search bar to filter tools by name, description, or tags (like 'free code completion' or 'GitHub Copilot'), with results updating as they type after 2+ characters. The sort dropdown on the right allows sorting by Popularity (default), Name A-Z, Rating, or Price, and works on both searched results and filtered tool lists. Search terms are highlighted in yellow in the results, and the 'Found X AI coding tools' counter updates to show current result count."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the AI tools directory to find specific coding tools. They want to find tools that match their needs by typing search terms and clicking a search button, then sorting results by their preferred criteria with clear visual feedback about what they found.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the AI tools directory page, **When** they type "GitHub Copilot" in the search bar and click the search button, **Then** the results should show only tools matching that term with "GitHub Copilot" highlighted in yellow
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** the user changes the sort dropdown to "Name A-Z", **Then** the current results should be re-ordered alphabetically by name
3. **Given** the user has searched for a term, **When** results are displayed, **Then** the counter should display "Found X AI coding tools" with the correct count
4. **Given** a user has search results displayed, **When** they clear the search bar and click search again, **Then** all tools should be displayed with the selected sort order applied
5. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** the user changes sort to "Rating", **Then** tools should be ordered from highest to lowest rating while maintaining search filtering

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no tools match the search criteria? ‚Üí Display "No results found" message
- How does sorting behave when tools have missing or null values for the sort field? ‚Üí Place items with null values at the end of the sorted list

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a search bar that accepts text input for filtering AI tools
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a search button that triggers filtering when clicked
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter tools by name, description, and tags based on search input
- **FR-004**: System MUST highlight search terms in yellow within the displayed results
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a sort dropdown with options: Popularity (default), Name A-Z, Rating, and Price
- **FR-006**: System MUST apply sorting to both full tool list and filtered search results
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a results counter showing "Found X AI coding tools" that updates with current result count
- **FR-008**: System MUST position the sort dropdown on the right side of the interface
- **FR-009**: System MUST set Popularity as the default sort option
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve sort selection when search is performed
- **FR-011**: System MUST display "No results found" message when no tools match search criteria
- **FR-012**: System MUST place tools with null values at the end when sorting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AI Tool**: Represents individual tools in the directory with name, description, tags, popularity score, rating, and price
- **Search Query**: User input text used for filtering tools
- **Sort Option**: Enumerated values for different sorting criteria (Popularity, Name A-Z, Rating, Price)
- **Search Result**: Filtered and sorted collection of AI tools based on current search and sort selections
