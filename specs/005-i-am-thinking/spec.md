# Feature Specification: Production-Grade Docker Containerization Setup

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-am-thinking`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I am thinking to introduce docker compose in the project so that I can streamline the development and then the deployment on my self hosted vps. I am maintaining the mingodb separately and passing connectionstring I want you to generate me an extensive production grade docker set-up for the project. Also add instructions and explanations in a separate readme file so that i can use the files appropriately in my project. there should be three docker compose file and related supporting file."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified need for comprehensive Docker setup for development and production
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, DevOps engineers, production environment
   ‚Üí Actions: containerize, deploy, develop, monitor
   ‚Üí Data: external MongoDB connection, environment configurations
   ‚Üí Constraints: self-hosted VPS, separate MongoDB instance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements clearly specified in user input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow, production deployment scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement maps to containerization capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Docker configurations, environment setups, deployment strategies
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All sections completed, no implementation details exposed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the CodiesVibe project, I need a comprehensive Docker containerization setup that allows me to develop efficiently locally and deploy reliably to production environments, while maintaining flexibility for different deployment strategies and monitoring capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh development environment, **When** a developer runs the development setup, **Then** the application starts with hot reload capabilities and connects to external MongoDB
2. **Given** a production VPS environment, **When** the production configuration is deployed, **Then** the application runs with proper reverse proxy, SSL termination, and monitoring
3. **Given** a need for Cloudflare integration, **When** the Cloudflare-specific setup is used, **Then** the application deploys with tunnel connectivity and proper routing
4. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline requirement, **When** pre-built images are used, **Then** deployment occurs with optimized container images and faster startup times
5. **Given** operational requirements, **When** monitoring stack is enabled, **Then** comprehensive metrics and logging are available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external MongoDB connection fails during container startup? ‚Üí Container MUST NOT start; MongoDB connection is mandatory
- How does the system handle environment variable misconfigurations? ‚Üí Display clear error message and prevent container startup
- How are container updates managed without service interruption? ‚Üí Planned downtime approach for container updates
- What occurs when SSL certificates need renewal in production? ‚Üí Planned downtime for certificate renewal process

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide separate Docker configurations for development, production, Cloudflare deployment, pre-built images, and monitoring
- **FR-002**: Development setup MUST support hot reload functionality for both frontend and backend components
- **FR-003**: Production setup MUST include reverse proxy with SSL termination and security headers
- **FR-004**: System MUST connect to external MongoDB instance using connection string configuration
- **FR-005**: All configurations MUST support environment-specific variable management
- **FR-006**: Production setup MUST include container health checks and restart policies
- **FR-007**: Monitoring configuration MUST provide comprehensive application and infrastructure metrics
- **FR-008**: System MUST include proper container networking and service discovery
- **FR-009**: All setups MUST follow security best practices for container deployment
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST provide clear instructions for each deployment scenario
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement fail-fast behavior for MongoDB connection failures and environment misconfigurations, preventing container startup with clear error messages

### Key Entities
- **Development Environment**: Local development setup with hot reload, volume mounting, and development-optimized configurations
- **Production Environment**: Production-ready setup with reverse proxy, SSL, security policies, and performance optimizations
- **Cloudflare Environment**: Specialized production setup optimized for Cloudflare Tunnels integration
- **Pre-built Image Environment**: CI/CD optimized setup using pre-built container images for faster deployments
- **Monitoring Stack**: Comprehensive observability setup with metrics, logging, and alerting capabilities
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific variable handling, secrets management, and connection configurations
