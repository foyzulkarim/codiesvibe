## 📝 **Notes for Future Implementation**

1. **Dependency Management**: Each spec builds on the previous ones - maintain this order for optimal results

2. **Backward Compatibility**: All future specs must maintain compatibility with the basic Docker setup from 005-i-am-thinking

3. **Documentation Updates**: Each spec should update the main README.md and relevant documentation

4. **Testing Strategy**: Every spec must include comprehensive testing before moving to the next

5. **Rollback Plans**: Each spec should include rollback procedures in case of implementation issues

---

**Remember**: The current Docker implementation (005-i-am-thinking) provides a solid foundation. These future specs are enhancements, not requirements for basic functionality.
