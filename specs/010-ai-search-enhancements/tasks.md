# Tasks: AI Search Enhancement v2.0

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-ai-search-enhancements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Found comprehensive implementation plan
   → Extract: LangGraph v2.0, transformers.js, multi-vector Qdrant search, context enrichment
2. Load optional design documents:
   → Only plan.md available (comprehensive enough for full implementation)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: dependencies, configuration, state schema
   → Tests: service tests, integration tests
   → Core: context enrichment, local NLP, multi-vector search
   → Integration: enhanced graph flow, result merging
   → Polish: performance optimization, monitoring, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Sequential execution only (no parallel tasks)
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Validate task completeness
```

## Dependencies
- Execute all tasks in sequential order (T001 → T002 → T003... → T067)
- Each task must be completed before starting the next one
- Tests within each phase must be completed before implementation tasks in that phase
- Foundation Setup (T001-T007) before all other phases
- All implementation before production readiness (T062-T067)

## Critical Success Metrics
- Context enrichment adds <200ms latency
- 70% of NLP queries processed locally
- 50% reduction in LLM API costs
- 10x+ increase in relevant tools found per entity
- <500ms response time for simple queries
- <2s response time for complex queries

## Implementation Notes
- Each service follows existing singleton pattern from codebase
- No need to maintain backward compatibility
- Multi-vector Qdrant strategy replaces MongoDB aggregation for context enrichment
- All new features include comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- A/B testing framework enables gradual rollout with metrics validation
