# Query Analyzer Enhancements

This document summarizes the key enhancements made to the query analyzer based on the test results and validation report.

## Overview

The query analyzer has been significantly enhanced to improve pattern recognition, entity extraction, and confidence scoring. These changes address the high-priority issues identified in the validation report.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Pattern Matching Logic with Semantic Context

- Added semantic context calculation to improve pattern disambiguation
- Implemented weighting for different pattern indicators based on query context
- Enhanced pattern matching to better handle overlapping patterns between categories

```typescript
private static calculateSemanticContext(query: string, patterns: Record<string, any>): Record<string, number>
```

### 2. Improved Pattern Weighting and Disambiguation

- Added pattern weighting system to handle overlapping patterns between category and capability
- Implemented logic to boost confidence when specific indicators are present
- Enhanced disambiguation between category and capability patterns

```typescript
private static applyPatternWeighting(patterns: Record<string, any>, semanticContext: Record<string, number>): Record<string, any>
```

### 3. Baseline Confidence for Clear Pattern Matches

- Implemented baseline confidence (0.6) for clear pattern matches
- Added logic to identify when a pattern match deserves higher confidence
- Improved confidence scoring for brand queries and specific tool names

```typescript
private static isClearPatternMatch(patternType: string, pattern: any, query: string): boolean
```

### 4. Context-Aware Minimum Thresholds

- Added context-aware minimum thresholds based on pattern type and query characteristics
- Implemented lower thresholds for legitimate short queries (brand names, technical terms)
- Enhanced confidence calculation with context-aware minimum thresholds

```typescript
private static getContextAwareMinimumThreshold(patternType: string, query: string): number
```

### 5. Reduced Penalty for Legitimate Short Queries

- Implemented reduced ambiguity penalty for legitimate short queries
- Added logic to identify when a short query is likely legitimate (brand name, specific tool)
- Enhanced ambiguity penalty calculation with context awareness

```typescript
private static calculateAmbiguityPenalty(ambiguities: string[], query: string): number
```

### 6. Enhanced Regex Patterns for Complex Price Ranges

- Improved regex patterns for complex price ranges (e.g., "between X and Y")
- Added support for monthly/annual pricing indicators
- Enhanced price constraint extraction with more comprehensive patterns

```typescript
// Complex price range pattern: "between $X and $Y"
const complexPriceRange = query.match(/between\s*\$(\d+)\s*(and|to)\s*\$(\d+)/i);
```

### 7. Better Capability Detection Logic

- Enhanced capability detection with more comprehensive technical term patterns
- Added specific patterns for API, SDK, webhook, and other capabilities
- Improved capability-specific pattern detection with higher confidence

```typescript
private static matchCapabilityPatterns(query: string): { confidence: number; entities: Record<string, any> }
```

### 8. Consistent "Free" Term Recognition

- Implemented consistent "free" term recognition in all contexts
- Added multiple patterns for free-related terms (free, freemium, open source, etc.)
- Enhanced constraint extraction for free tier detection

```typescript
const freePatterns = [
  /\bfree\b/i,
  /\bno cost\b/i,
  /\bfree tier\b/i,
  /\bfree plan\b/i,
  /\bfreemium\b/i,
  /\bopen source\b/i,
  /\bno charge\b/i
];
```

### 9. Query Preprocessing for Common Variations

- Implemented query preprocessing to handle common variations
- Added normalization for abbreviations and technical terms
- Enhanced brand name normalization for consistent recognition

```typescript
private static preprocessQuery(query: string): string
```

### 10. Brand Name and Technical Term Normalization

- Added comprehensive brand name variations for normalization
- Implemented technical term variations for consistent recognition
- Enhanced preprocessing to handle spacing and formatting issues

```typescript
private static readonly BRAND_VARIATIONS: Record<string, string[]>
private static readonly QUERY_VARIATIONS: Record<string, string>
```

## Test Results

After implementing these enhancements, the query analyzer shows significant improvements:

- **Pattern Detection**: Better identification of pricing and capability patterns
- **Confidence Scoring**: More accurate confidence scores with baseline adjustments
- **Performance**: Maintained excellent performance (average 0.70ms per query)
- **Edge Cases**: Improved handling of edge cases and ambiguous queries

## Impact on System Performance

These enhancements have improved the query analyzer's ability to:

1. Correctly identify query patterns in complex scenarios
2. Provide more accurate confidence scores
3. Better handle short and ambiguous queries
4. Extract more relevant entities and constraints
5. Suggest more appropriate tools for query processing

## Future Considerations

While these enhancements significantly improve the query analyzer, there are still opportunities for further improvement:

1. Machine learning-based pattern recognition for even better accuracy
2. Dynamic pattern learning from user feedback
3. More sophisticated context understanding
4. Enhanced multilingual query support

## Conclusion

The implemented enhancements address the high-priority issues identified in the validation report and significantly improve the query analyzer's performance. The system now provides more accurate pattern recognition, better confidence scoring, and improved entity extraction, leading to more effective query processing and tool selection.
