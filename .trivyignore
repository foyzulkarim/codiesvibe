# Trivy Ignore File
# This file contains security vulnerabilities that are intentionally ignored with justification

# expr-eval vulnerabilities (2 HIGH severity issues)
# CVE-2025-12735: expr-eval does not restrict functions passed to the evaluate function
# CVE-2025-13204: expr-eval vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
#
# JUSTIFICATION FOR IGNORING:
# - NO FIX AVAILABLE: Latest expr-eval version is 2.0.2 (the vulnerable version)
# - TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY: Comes from @langchain/community@^0.3.57
# - CANNOT UPGRADE: Upgrading to @langchain/community@1.x requires @langchain/core@^1.0.0
#   but we use @langchain/core@^0.3.78, causing breaking peer dependency conflicts
# - NOT DIRECTLY USED: We don't use expr-eval directly in our code
# - MITIGATION: The search-api doesn't expose user-controlled evaluation of expressions
#
# RESOLUTION PLAN:
# - Monitor @langchain/community releases for expr-eval removal or safe alternative
# - Upgrade entire LangChain ecosystem to 1.x when compatible
# - Re-evaluate when expr-eval releases a patched version
#
# DATE ADDED: 2025-11-19
# REVIEW DATE: 2026-01-01 (or when @langchain/core@1.x is stable)
